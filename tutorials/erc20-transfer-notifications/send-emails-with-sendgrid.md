# Send emails with SendGrid

## Introduction

Today we will learn how to create and use a MESG service that send email using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com).

You can access the final version of the [source code on GitHub](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/docs/tree/master/tutorials/erc20-transfer-notifications/send-email-with-sendgrid).

You can find a more advanced and maintained version of this service here: [Service Email SendGrid](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/service-email-sendgrid)

::: tip
If you haven't installed **MESG SDK** yet, follow [this guide](/guide/installation.md).
:::

MESG services are composed of two different parts:

* **Tasks:** actions that your service will execute
* **Events:** data that your service provides

For this step of this tutorial, we will only focus on tasks.

## Create the MESG service

It's time to create our MESG Service. First, open a terminal in your development folder and run the following command:

```bash
mesg-cli service:init ./service-email-sendgrid-tuto
```

Then, select the `Javascript` template.

The command should have created a `service-email-sendgrid-tuto` folder containing the boilerplate files for the service.
Leave these files intact; we'll return to them a bit later in this tutorial.

::: tip
You should see a **mesg.yml** and a **Dockerfile** in your service folder which are the fundamental parts of every MESG service.

* **mesg.yml:** A file that contains all of the metadata of your Service. It gives some global descriptions but also includes the tasks and events that the Service can provide.

* **Dockerfile:** A file that describes your Docker container and configures the environment for your service to run inside.

## Send emails through a task

### Configure your task

Let's define the task we want to create in the `mesg.yml` file.

First, clean the `mesg.yml` file, keeping only the keys: `name`, `sid` and `description`. Change their value to look like this:

```yaml
name: Send Email with SendGrid Tutorial
sid: service-email-sendgrid-tuto
description: Send Email with SendGrid
```

Add the key `configuration`, containing the key `env`, containing the env `SENDGRID_API_KEY` like this:

```yaml
configuration:
  env:
    - SENDGRID_API_KEY=
```

This env variable will contain the required SendGrid API Key.

And add a new task called `send` to `tasks` section which will be responsible for sending an email based on the following inputs:

* **from**: the account to send the email from
* **to**: the recipient of the email
* **subject**: the subject of the email
* **text**: the text of the email

Also this Service's task will return a status as outputs:

* **status**: status of the sent email

To add this information into your Service, add the following definition in the `mesg.yml` file:

```yaml
tasks:
  send:
    inputs:
      from:
        type: String
      to:
        type: String
      subject:
        type: String
      text:
        type: String
    outputs:
      status:
        type: Number
```

The content of `mesg.yml` should look like:

<<< @/tutorials/erc20-transfer-notifications/send-email-with-sendgrid/mesg.yml

### Code the task

The next step is to code your Service. To do this, you can use any language that you want. For this tutorial we will use **Javascript**.

Open `index.js` and replace `taskX` words to `send` and remove `emitEvent` line since it'll not be used in this tutorial.

Your `index.js` should look similar to this:

```javascript
const Service = require('@mesg/service')
const mesg = new Service()

mesg.listenTask({
  send: require('./tasks/send')
})
  .on('error', (error) => console.error(error))
```

With this code, service will start listening execution requests for `send` task from **MESG Engine** and execute the handler to create and submit a result.

To create a handler for the `send` task, rename `tasks/taskX.js` to `tasks/send.js` and replace its content with the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = (inputs) => {
  console.log('New send task received')
  // TODO later
}
```

This is a basic skeleton for a Service, but now we need to actually code the emails with SendGrid. For this, we will use the SendGrid library.

```bash
npm install --save @sendgrid/mail
```

Then require it in `send.js`:

```javascript
const sendgrid = require('@sendgrid/mail')
```

Then, pass the content of the env variable `SENDGRID_API_KEY` to sendgrid:
```javascript
sendgrid.setApiKey(process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY)
```

We had a `TODO` in our handler for `send` task, let's code the business logic using the SendGrid library we just imported.

```javascript
module.exports = async (inputs) => {
  console.log('New send task received')
  // Sends an email with the inputs
  const result = await sendgrid.send({
    from: inputs.from,
    to: inputs.to,
    subject: inputs.subject,
    text: inputs.text
  })
  // Return the success output
  return {
    status: result[0].statusCode
  }
}
```

This code sends an email with the inputs defined in the `mesg.yml` and returns the status code.

Now your final Service code should look like this:

`index.js`

<<< @/tutorials/erc20-transfer-notifications/send-email-with-sendgrid/index.js

`tasks/send.js`

<<< @/tutorials/erc20-transfer-notifications/send-email-with-sendgrid/tasks/send.js

Your Service is now ready for the second step.

## Testing

Make sure MESG Engine is running:

```bash
mesg-cli daemon:start
```

Let's create a test file to test the `send` task. Create a `test.json` file with all the inputs needed for the task.

<<< @/tutorials/erc20-transfer-notifications/send-email-with-sendgrid/test.json

::: warning
Replace the **\_\_YOUR\_EMAIL\_\_** with your own email to test it. Don't worry, this is only done locally. We will not collect it ðŸ˜€
:::

Now time to test it.

::: warning
You now need to get your own private SendGrid API key. You can create it here: [https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys](https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/api_keys)â€‹.
:::

Let's start the service by running the command:

```bash
mesg-cli service:dev --env SENDGRID_API_KEY=__CHANGE_WITH_YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY__
```

Replace `__CHANGE_WITH_YOUR_SENDGRID_API_KEY__` by the SendGrid API Key.

Wait for the service to start and then in an other terminal (make sure to point the terminal in the service folder), execute the following command:

```bash
mesg-cli service:execute service-email-sendgrid-tuto send --json test.json
```

The `send` task will be executed and you should have the result with status `202` in the console and your precious email in your mailbox.

Stop the service by pressing `ctrl + c` in the terminal.

::: tip Congratulation!  ðŸŽ‰
Get some rest now, you've done a good job creating your first Service with MESG. Of course you can always create more complicated Services. Make sure to check out the [documentation](/) for more details.
