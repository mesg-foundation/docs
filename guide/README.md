# Introduction

MESG \(pronounced Ëˆmesij/, or **message**\) is a technology-agnostic network of [Services](./service/what-is-a-service.md) used to build autonomous applications. 

Services (also known as Modules) are often used as communication bridges from an application to 3rd-party technologies like blockchains, IoT devices, databases, notifications or business logic. Services can be responsible for many of the UX-friendly features users love.

[Applications](./application/what-is-an-application.md) can contain many Services, and much of the code in Services is often identical between applications. To increase development efficiency, and decrease the often-steep learning curve, Services on MESG can be shared and reused through the [Marketplace](https://github.com/mesg-foundation/awesome). 

Interoperability (free communication) between all Services and Applications is automatically managed by MESG Core. [Core](./start-here/installation.md) organizes and dispatches information to and from all connected Services and routes it through a stream of real-time information to your Application. By allowing Core to do the heavy lifting, applications on MESG can remain highly interconnected, yet lightweight, powerful and maintainable.

Applications on MESG can look like anything from an product-integrated DApp store, to a bookkepping workflow, or a link from real-time notifications to blockchain events. The possibilities and use cases are endless.

**In Q1 2020**, MESG will launch the decentralized Network to complete the MESG infrastructure and launch the full MESG Economy. It will make it simple to incorporate variably-decentralized executions into feature-rich apps.

The Network will debut MESG's full token-based economy. Pre-built Services (Modules) will be bought and sold on the Network using MESG Tokens, while network participants will be rewarded for powering and securing the network.
